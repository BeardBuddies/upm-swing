Universal Password Manager
--------------------------
UPM is a cross platform password manager. I've used a number of different password managers over the years but I never quite found one that fulfilled all my requirements. At work I use MS Windows but at home I use a Mac. What I wanted was a password manage that would run on both platforms and would share the same password database. Version 1.0 of UPM satisfies the first of these requirements and I'm hoping that I'll be able to fulfil the second one very soon.

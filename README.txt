Universal Password Manager
--------------------------
UPM is a cross platform password manager. I've used a number of different password managers over the years but I never quite found one that fulfilled all my requirements. At work I use MS Windows but at home I use a Mac. What I wanted was a password manager that would run on both platforms and would share the same password database. Version 1.0 of UPM satisfies the first of these requirements and I'm hoping that I'll be able to fulfil the second one very soon.

Universal Password Manager is a cross platform password manager. The main attraction of this password manager over others is that it's small, fast and easy to use. It's been tested and localised for use on both Windows and Mac OS X.

Universal Password Manager
--------------------------
UPM is a cross platform password manager. Over the years I've used a number of different password managers but I never quite found one that gave me everything I needed. At work I use MS Windows but at home I use a Mac. What I wanted was a password manager that would run on both platforms and share the same password database. Version 1.0 of UPM satisfies the first of these requirements. I'm hoping that another release soon after will fulfil the second.


Features
--------
.Small, fast and lean
.Written in Java and utilises Swing for the GUI
.Windows and Mac OS X native feeling versions available
.Fast Account searching
.Streamlined for those who are more comfortable using the keyboard only
.Uses DES with 56 bit keys to encrypt the database


Roadmap
-------
.Shared Password Database (so that the same database can be used from many machines)
.Choice of encryption algorithms
.Password generator
.Linux distributions (RPM, DEB)
.Internationalisation
.Commandline interface

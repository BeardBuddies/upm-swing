Universal Password Manager
--------------------------
UPM is a cross platform password manager. Over the years I've used a number of different password managers but I never quite found one that gave me everything I needed. At work I use MS Windows but at home I use a Mac. What I wanted was a password manager that would run on both platforms and share the same password database. Version 1.0 of UPM satisfies the first of these requirements. I'm hoping that another release soon after will fulfil the second.
